  "description": "LiNEAR Protocol is a liquid staking solution built on the NEAR Protocol.\n\nLiNEAR provides the best yield for the stakers while making NEAR more decentralized and censorship resistant.\n\n LiNEAR unlocks liquidity of the staked NEAR by creating a staking derivative to be engaged with various DeFi protocols on NEAR and Aurora, while also enjoying over 10% APY staking rewards of the underlying base tokens. LiNEAR is the cornerstone piece of the NEAR-Aurora DeFi ecosystem.\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95207870/236612150-78cceec6-ad4d-4c78-aa96-2ddc9afba1bf.png)",
